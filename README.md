# Dojo5 Practical Challenge
Choose one of the following practical challenges. Check your code into a repo on your choice of GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket and add a link to the location it is stored here. Include a README.md in the repo to describe any overview, notes, or design considerations you took while going through the exercise. Include appropriate tests as part of your deliverable.

My repo is located: <URL HERE>

Option 1: Charts (chosen option)
Build a small React site that demonstrates integration of a charting library. The data can be fake, but should allow for the user to interact with it in some way.

# Notes
Although not explictly instructed to do so, this sample includes a menuing system with several pages for a greater app experience. Additionally, a design methodology was not specified so it was arbitrarily designed using function rather than class based approach. It uses Recharts for the charting package, present a couple of chart options, and a button for the user to interface with the charts in order to toggle the data axes. It uses Cypress for testing purposes.

# Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Automatically installs all packages required for running the app.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run cypress`
Launches the Cypress testing app. To run the Dojo5 tests, select Dojo5.spec.js.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
